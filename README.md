# airbnb_analysis
This project is an introduction to Airbnb prices-location analysis.

First we're analyzing only ask prices for 2020 in Seattle and the reviews made by other customers in each neighborhood.

The second purpose is to extend this project to other cities and even other product analysis.

## INSTALLATION
Dependencies:

- python (>= 3.6)       https://www.python.org/downloads/

### Project motivation

For this project I just wanted to:

- Perform a descriptive analysis in AirBnb ask prices considering it's not possible to access bid prices.
- Perform then any necessary diagnostic analysis in some time interval (holidays or seasons beginning/ending)
- No predictive analysis was performed **yet**. Considering ask prices is exactly the prices to book a stay in the future.
